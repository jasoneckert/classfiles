	Jerusalem


And did those feet in ancient times,
Walk upon England's mountains green?
And was the holy lamb of God,
On England's pleasant pastures seen?


And did the countenance divine
Shine forth upon our darkened hills?
And was Jerusalem builded here,
Among these dark satanic mills.


Bring me my bow of burning gold.
Bring me my arrows of desire.
Bring me my spear, Oh clouds unfold!
Bring me my chariot of fire!


I will not cease from endless fight!
Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand,
'til we have built Jerusalem
On England's green and pleasant land.

					William Blake
