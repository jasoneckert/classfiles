Jack and Jill went up the hill
to fetch a pail of water.
Jack fell down, and broke his crown,
and Jill came tumbling after!


Hark! Hark!  The dogs do bark!
The beggars are coming to town.
Some in rags, some in tags,
and some in velvet gowns.


The right brave Duke of York,
he had 10,000 men.
He marched them up the hill,
then marched them down again.


Georgie Porgie puddin' and pie,
kissed the girls and made them cry.
When the boys came out to play,
Georgie Porgie ran away!

Peter, Peter, pumpkin eater.
Had a wife and couldn't keep her.
Put her in a pumpkin shell,
and there he kept her very well.


White Coral Bells upon a slender stalk.
Lilies of the Valleys deck my garden walk.
Oh how I wish, that I could hear them ring.
That will only happen when the faeries sing!
