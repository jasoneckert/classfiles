I would that we were, my beloved, white birds on the foam
	of the sea!
We tire of the flame of the meteor, before it can fade and flee;
And the flame of the blue star of twilight, hung low on the rim
	or the sky,
Has awakened in our hears, my beloved, a sadness that may not
	die.

A weariness comes from those dreamers, dew-dabbled, the lily
	and rose;
Ah, dream not of them , my beloved, the flame of the meteor 
	that goes,
Or the flame of the blue star that lingers hung low in the fall
	of the dew:
For I would we were changed to white birds on the wandering
	foam: I and you!

I am haunted by numberless islands, and many a Danaan
	shore,
Where Time would surely forget us, and Sorrow come
	near us no more;
Soon far from the rose and the lily and fret of the flames would
	we be, 
Were we only white birds, my beloved, buoyed out on the foam 
	of the sea!
