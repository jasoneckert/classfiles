John, by the grace of God  King  of  England,
Lord   of   Ireland,  Duke  of  Normandy  and
Aquitaine,  and  Count  of  Anjou,   to   his
archbishops,  bishops, abbots, earls, barons,
justices,  foresters,   sheriffs,   stewards,
servants,  and to all his officials and loyal
subjects, Greeting.

Know that before God, for the health  of  our
soul and those of our ancestors and heirs, to
the honour of God, the exaltation of the holy
Church,   and  the  better  ordering  of  our
kingdon,  at  the  advice  of  our   reverend
fathers  Stephen,  archbishop  of Canterbury,
primate of all England, and cardinal  of  the
holy   Roman   Church,  Henry  archbishop  of
Dublin,  William  bishop  of  London,   Peter
bishop  of Winchester, Jocelin bishop of Bath
and  Glastonbury,  Hugh  bishop  of  Lincoln,
Walter bishop of Coventry, Benedict bishop of
Rochester,  Master  Pandulf   subdeacon   and
member   of   the  papal  household,  Brother
Aymeric  master  of  the  knighthood  of  the
Temple  in  England,  William Marshal earl of
Pembroke, William earl of Salisbury,  William
earl of Warren, William earl of Arundel, Alan
de Galloway constable of Scotland, Warin Fitz
Gerald,  Peter  Fitz Herbert, Hubert de Bergh
seneschal of Poitou, Hugh de Neville, Matthew
Fitz  Herbert,  Thomas  Basset,  Alan Basset,
Philip  Daubeny,  Robert  de  Poppeley,  John
Marshal,  John  Fitz  Hugh,  and  other loyal
subjects:

First, that we have granted to  God,  and  by
this  present  charter  have confirmed for us
and our heirs in perpetuity, that the English
Church  shall  be  free,  and  shall have its
rights  undiminished,   and   its   liberties
unimpaired.   That  we  wish  this  so  to be
observed, appears from the fact that  of  our
own  free  will,  before  the outbreak of the
present dispute between us and our barons, we
granted  and confirmed by charter the freedom
of the Church's elections -- a right reckoned
to   be   of   the   greatest  necessity  and
importance to it -- and  caused  this  to  be
confirmed by Pope Innocent III.  This freedom
we shall observe ourselves, and desire to  be
observed  in  good  faith  by  our  heirs  in
perpetuity.
