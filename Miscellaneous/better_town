HOW SMALL IS SMALL?

YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE IN A SMALL TOWN WHEN...
   The airport runway is terraced.
   The polka is more popular than a mashpit on Saturday night.
   Third Street is on the edge of town.
   Every sport is played on dirt.
   The editor and publisher of the newspaper carries a camera at all times.
   You don't use your turn signal because everyone knows where you are going.

   You are born on June 13 and your family receives gifts from the local
      merchants because you are the first baby of the year.
   You speak to each dog you pass by name and he wags at you.
   You dial a wrong number and talk for 15 minutes anyway.
   You are run off Main Street by a combine.

   You can't walk for exercise because every car that passes you offers you a
      ride.
   You get married and the local paper devotes a quarter page to the story.
   You drive into a ditch 5 miles out of town and the word gets back to town
      before you do.

   The biggest business on town sells farm machinery.
   You write a check on the wrong bank and it covers you anyway.
   The pickups on Main Street outnumber the cars three to one.
   You miss church on Sunday and someone sends you a get well card.
   Someone asks you how you feel and then listens to what you say.

Thank God for small towns... and the people who live in them.
