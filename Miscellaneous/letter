Hello Mother!  Hello Father!

Here I am at Camp Granada.  Things are very entertaining,
and they say we'll have some fun when it stops raining.

All the counselors hate the waiters, and the lake has
alligators.  You remember Leonard Skinner?  He got
ptomaine poisoning last night after dinner.

Now I don't want this to scare you, but my bunk mate has
malaria.  You remember Jeffrey Hardy?  Their about to 
organize a searching party.

Take me home, oh Mother, Father, take me home! I hate Granada. 
Don't leave me out in the forest where I might get eaten 
by a bear!  Take me home, I promise that I won't make noise,
or mess the house with other boys, oh please don't make me
stay -- I've been here one whole day.

Dearest Father, darling Mother, how's my precious little
brother?  I will come home if you miss me.  I will even
let Aunt Bertha hug and kiss me!

Wait a minute!  It's stopped hailing!  Guys are swimming!
Guys are sailing!  Playing baseball, gee that's better!
Mother, Father, kindly disregard this letter.
